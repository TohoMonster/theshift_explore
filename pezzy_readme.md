# Readme for Project

My attempt at rebuilding https://theshift.tokyo/en/, which I found on http://www.awwwards.com.

This site has some cool scroll-based transforms. 

This site uses WordPress. I think this is a commercial theme rather than a customer website (which fits with the commercial/self-promiotional nature of awwwards.com).
